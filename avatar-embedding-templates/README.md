## How to Use

4. Customize the avatars by changing colors, adding accessories, and modifying hairstyles.

## Converting to Single HTML File

To convert the modular code with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files into a single HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file and add the contents of the CSS file within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
2. Add the contents of the JS file within a `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Support Panel</title>
    <style>
      /* Add CSS content here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML content here -->
    <script>
      // Add JS content here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
