4. Enable the sharing toggle to generate a sharing link

5. Add **<toddc@portalis.ai>** to the "Whitelist emails" section. This is crucial as it ensures that only specified accounts can access the voice (or leave it blank, but then anyone with the link should be able to add the voice, but I would recommend using the whitelist).

6. Send the sharing link to **<emmanuel@portalis.ai>**.
